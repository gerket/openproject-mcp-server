# OpenProject MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server providing comprehensive integration with the [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) API v3. Enables Claude and other MCP-compatible LLMs to read and manage projects, work packages, users, queries, file links, notifications, time entries, and more.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- An OpenProject instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- An OpenProject API token — User menu → Account settings → Access tokens → + API Token

### Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gerket/openproject-mcp-server.git
cd openproject-mcp-server
uv sync

# Run the server (stdio transport for Claude Code)
OPENPROJECT_URL=https://your-instance.openproject.com \
OPENPROJECT_API_KEY=your-api-token \
uv run openproject-mcp
```

### Claude Code setup

Add to your project `.mcp.json` or global `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openproject": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "/path/to/openproject-mcp-server", "openproject-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENPROJECT_URL": "https://your-instance.openproject.com",
        "OPENPROJECT_API_KEY": "your-api-token",
        "OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS": "write"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Tip:** Start with `OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS=write` (read-only) for daily use. Expand to specific resources (e.g., `work-packages,projects`) or remove the filter for full access.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENPROJECT_URL` | ✅ | Base URL of your OpenProject instance |
| `OPENPROJECT_API_KEY` | ✅ | API token from Account settings → Access tokens |
| `OPENPROJECT_PROXY` | — | HTTP proxy URL (e.g. `http://proxy.company.com:8080`) |
| `OPENPROJECT_CA_BUNDLE` | — | Path to custom CA bundle for self-signed TLS certs |
| `OPENPROJECT_MCP_INCLUDE_TAGS` | — | Comma-separated tags — only expose matching tools |
| `OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS` | — | Comma-separated tags — hide matching tools |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | — | `DEBUG`, `INFO` (default), `WARNING`, `ERROR` |

---

## Tool filtering with tags

> **Migration (breaking):** the `core` / `situational` profile tags and their
> `*-read` / `*-write` derivatives have been removed in favor of per-endpoint
> resource tags. If you previously used `OPENPROJECT_MCP_INCLUDE_TAGS=core-read`,
> switch to an explicit recipe such as `OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS=write`
> (read-only) or list the resources you need (e.g., `work-packages,projects`).

Every tool carries up to 5 tags. Setting `OPENPROJECT_MCP_INCLUDE_TAGS` / `OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS` controls which tools are registered with the MCP client, improving Claude's tool selection accuracy by reducing noise.

### Tag types

| Tag | Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Access | `read`, `write` | Whether the tool reads or mutates data |
| Resource | 34 endpoint tags: `work-packages`, `activities`, `relations`, `hierarchy`, `watchers`, `types`, `statuses`, `priorities`, `projects`, `categories`, `versions`, `queries`, `views`, `users`, `groups`, `roles`, `memberships`, `placeholder-users`, `principals`, `preferences`, `time-entries`, `time-entry-activities`, `budgets`, `attachments`, `documents`, `news`, `wiki`, `storages`, `file-links`, `notifications`, `reminders`, `custom-actions`, `reports`, `system` | The API endpoint the tool targets — one per tool |
| Composite | `<resource>-read`, `<resource>-write` (e.g., `versions-read`, `time-entries-write`) | Select a resource AND an access level in one include filter |
| Permission | `admin` | Tools requiring OpenProject admin role |
| Name | `list_work_packages`, `create_query`, etc. | Exact function name — cherry-pick individual tools |

### Filtering examples

```bash
# Read-only server (all resources, reads only)
OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS=write

# Only work-package tools
OPENPROJECT_MCP_INCLUDE_TAGS=work-packages

# Work packages + projects, reads only
OPENPROJECT_MCP_INCLUDE_TAGS=work-packages,projects
OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS=write

# Everything except admin operations
OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS=admin

# Mixed: read versions but write time entries (composites)
OPENPROJECT_MCP_INCLUDE_TAGS=versions-read,time-entries-write

# Hide storage tools (no file server configured)
OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS=storages,file-links

# Full access — default when no env var is set
```

### Discovery tools

Two `system` tools help you inspect what's available:
- **`list_capabilities`** — returns a filter-aware summary of active tools (grouped by category, one-line descriptions) and inactive tools (when tag filters are applied). Includes the tag reference and configuration examples.
- **`describe_tool(tool_names: list[str])`** — returns full documentation for one or more tools by name, including inactive/filtered-out tools. The only way to inspect a tool that's been disabled.

## Running tests

```bash
# Unit tests (network-free, 192 tests)
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest

# Live integration tests against a real instance
# Run the one-time setup script first:
OPENPROJECT_URL=https://your-instance OPENPROJECT_API_KEY=your-token \
uv run python scripts/setup_test_project.py

# Then run the suite:
uv run pytest tests/integration -m integration -v

# Single module:
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_versions.py -m integration -v
```

See `docs/integration-test-setup.md` for the full click-ops checklist required to enable all 79 integration test scenarios.

## Notes on specific modules

**Custom actions:** `GET /custom_actions` (collection) returns 404 on Community Edition. Use `get_custom_action(id)` with a known ID discovered from the admin UI. `execute_custom_action` works on all editions.

**Costs / budgets:** The v3 API exposes budgets read-only (`list_budgets`, `get_budget`). Cost entry management (`/cost_types`, `/cost_entries`) is not in the core v3 spec — those endpoints return 404 on standard installations.

**Storage / file links:** Requires a file storage (OneDrive, Nextcloud) configured in Administration → File storages. Tools skip gracefully with informative messages when no storage is configured. Use `OPENPROJECT_MCP_EXCLUDE_TAGS=storage` to hide these tools on instances without file servers.

**Admin tools:** `create_user`, `update_user`, `delete_placeholder_user`, `create_project`, `delete_project` require administrator role. `delete_user` is not implemented — `DELETE /users/{id}` returns 403 via API regardless of role; use `update_user(status="locked")` to disable an account.

**Time entry activities:** The `/time_entries/activities` endpoint does not exist in v3. Activities are discovered via the create-form schema — the client fetches them automatically when needed.

**Custom fields:** Long-text/Markdown fields (`Formattable` type) are auto-wrapped to `{"raw": "..."}` by the client. A verify check raises loudly if a write is silently dropped.

**Attachments:** Uses OpenProject's two-part multipart upload (`metadata` JSON + `file` binary). Returns 500 on instances with misconfigured attachment storage.

## Architecture

```
src/
  client.py          — Async OpenProject API v3 client (aiohttp, retry/backoff)
  server.py          — FastMCP server + env-var tag filtering
  tools/             — One module per API domain (25 modules)
  utils/
    formatting.py    — Markdown formatters
    report_formatter.py — Weekly report generation
scripts/
  setup_test_project.py — One-time integration test environment setup
tests/
  unit/              — 192 network-free unit tests
  integration/       — 79 live integration tests (pytest -m integration)
docs/
  integration-test-setup.md — Click-ops checklist for test environment
  superpowers/plans/ — Phase-by-phase API coverage master plan
```

All tools return formatted Markdown strings and catch all exceptions via `format_error(...)`. The server dynamically computes the tool count at startup and logs it.

```

**Tag rule for new tools:** every `@tracked_tool` must carry `{access, resource, resource-access, tool_name}` (plus `admin` where applicable). Pick the one `resource` tag for the OpenProject endpoint the tool targets — the canonical list of 34 resources is `_CATEGORY_ORDER` in `src/tools/server_info.py`; `list_capabilities` shows the live grouping. The composite is `<resource>-<access>` (e.g. a `write` tool on `versions` carries `versions-write`).

`test_full_sweep` in `tests/unit/test_tags.py` enforces, per tool: exactly one access tag (`read`/`write`); exactly one resource tag; at least one composite whose suffix matches the access tag; and every composite's prefix equals the tool's resource tag. Resource tags map to API endpoints, not source modules — e.g. comment/activity tools across `work_packages.py` and `watchers.py` all use `activities`, and file-link tools in `storages.py` use `file-links`.
